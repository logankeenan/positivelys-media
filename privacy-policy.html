    Last Updated:
    <time datetime="2021-03-04">March 03, 2021</time>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes the practices of Positivelys for collecting, using, maintaining,
        disclosing, and otherwise processing (collectively, “Processing”) the information that we collect from you, as well
        as
        how we protect and secure your data. If you have additional questions regarding your rights under this Policy or any
        agreement you may have with Positivelys regarding your data, please contact us at support@positivelys.com.
        Please read
        this
        Policy carefully to understand our Processing of your information and how we will treat it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Policy generally applies to the information that Positivelys Processes. However, this Policy is subordinate to
        any specific terms and conditions set forth in any terms of use, end user license agreements, or other agreements
        you
        may have with us relating to a particular product, service, or data. Further, this Policy applies only to
        information
        that we Process. It does not apply to information our business partners may collect, and these business partners may
        have their own privacy policies that apply to you.
    </p>

            <span class="bold">What information does Positivelys collect?</span>
            <p>
                The information we collect can be described as Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. We collect
                this
                information when you provide it to us or when you use our products or services.
                “Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify, locate, or contact you, a natural person, as
                well as any other information about you that we may connect with Personal Information. For example, Personal
                Information that we collect includes:
                Contact information such as your name, email address, username, and password;
                Relationship information such as your application preferences;
                Transactional information such as purchases, services requested, customer service inquiries, and other customer
                account information; and
                Financial information such as credit card or banking information necessary to process payment for the Online
                Services.
                “Non-Personal Information,” on the other hand, is information that does not identify you as a natural person and
                is not identifiable to you as a natural person. For example, Non-Personal Information that we collect includes:
                Information that we anonymize by rendering it unidentifiable to a natural person.
                We believe in minimizing the data collected. If we decide to collect more categories of Personal Information, we
                will disclose it to you at the time it is collected and will post an update to this Policy.
            </p>

            <span class="bold">Why does Positivelys collect this information?</span>
            <p>
                We collect and process Personal Information for a variety of purposes, depending on the information being
                Processed. In particular, we Process this information to provide our products and services to you, and support
                you
                in using them. We also Process information to pursue our legitimate interest in improving and protecting our
                products and services and enhancing customer experience. Finally, we may Process information as necessary to
                comply with our legal obligations.
                To summarize, we Process Personal Information for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To fulfill orders for our products and services;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To operate, deliver, maintain, or otherwise provide the products and services you request;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To support our products and services;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To set up and maintain your customer account;

                <li>
                    To improve our products and services; and
                </li>
                <li>As necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pt-2">
                We believe in limiting the collection of Personal Information to only what is necessary to accomplish these
                specific
                purposes. If we decide to collect or Process your Personal Information for any other purposes, we will disclose
                it
                to you at the time it is collected and will post an update to this Policy.

      Will Positivelys share this information with third parties?
    </span>
            <p>
                To provide our products and services, we have to share information with third parties that provide services to
                us,
                such as Digital Ocean and CloudFlare. Any third party with whom we share Personal Information will only have the
                access necessary to perform defined tasks on our behalf, will only use the information accessed for this
                purpose,
                and will protect your information at least to the same extent that we do.
                Aside from this, we may share information to comply with our legal obligations, such as to respond to lawful
                requests and legal processes. In the event we are asked to disclose Personal Information, we will attempt to
                validate the request and inform you of it.
                Finally, we may share information if needed to affect the sale or transfer of our assets, enforce our rights,
                protect our property, protect the rights, property, or safety of others, or as needed to support external
                auditing, compliance, and corporate governance functions.
                We believe in being transparent. If we need to share your Personal Information for another purpose, we will
                obtain
                your consent before doing so and we will disclose this purpose at the time of obtaining your consent. For
                example,
                we may wish to use your information in demonstrations or other marketing materials, but will contact you before
                doing so.
